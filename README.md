[CUTE]{:target="_blank"}(http://www.cute-test.com) is an easy to use C++ unit testing framework that leverages modern C++ libraries and features. CUTE is orthogonal, easily extendable and much simpler than other C++ unit testing approaches like CPPUnit. For example, CUTE does not require that you write a derived class for each C++ class you want to unit test.
